## VEX Robotics Coding Projects

Created by the main programmer of team 6724C (Daniel Shin). As the team determined that a dual driver system (a system commonly utilized by almost all VEX teams) was inefficient, the code contains various optimizations so that a user-friendly, readily controllable system is created.

## Project List:
* VEX 2017-2018 Season: In The Zone
* VEX 2018-2019 Season: Turning Point
* VEX 2019-2020 Season: Tower Takeover

Note that detailed code description is provided in readme of each folder
